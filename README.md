I was browsing through Kaggle datasets and found this one on crimes in Chicago. The data is stored in Google Cloud's BigQuery, a data warehouse. This was a new format for me and accessing the data was tricky at first and also required knowledge of SQL commands. I was curious about this data because I had just watched a Numberphile on the mathematics of crime. Assuming independence of crime cases, occurences of crime should roughly follow the poisson distribution. My first goal was to visualize the distribution of crimes. I'll attach some of the plots along with the code but what I found is that for some districts, crime did sort of follow a poisson distribution and had the characteristic bell curve shape.
